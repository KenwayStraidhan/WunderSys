WunderSys: an Achaean ServerSide Curing System
(originally developed by Nemutaur)

See https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/6980966/ServersideSystem/index.html for most of the system details. This github project is for collaborative development (or development period until Nemutaur gets back to this). The current intent is to not duplicate any documentation here.
